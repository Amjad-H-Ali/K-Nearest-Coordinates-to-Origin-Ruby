# K-Nearest-Coordinates-to-Origin-Ruby

#### We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the ```K``` closest points to the origin ```(0, 0)```.

#### (Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

#### Points: 

```(-2, -4), (0, -2), (-1, 0), (3, -5), (-2, -3), (3, 2), (11, 2), (8, 0), (4, 5), (15, 2), (9, -9), (0,0)```

#### Output: 

```[(0, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -2), (-2, -3), (3, 2)]```
